Basic data that we'll need someday

Sometimes we need to import basic common knowledge data into our projects. But the data is hard to find in a usable format.
This repository contains files of common knowledge inforation in easy to use formats such as CSV or plain text.
Hope you find this useful.
If you can think of any other data this repo should include, please contribute or let me know.

Enjoy!
